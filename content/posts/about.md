# About Me

🎓 I am currently in my last year of **Telecommunications Engineering** at **Universidad Politécnica de Madrid**. I am focused on finishing my degree and doing as many activities as possible to expand my knowledge.

| 💻 I have expertise in programming languages like **Java** and **MATLAB**. I also understand **signal processing**, **network protocols**, **wireless communications**, and **fiber optics**. {{< figure src="/img/fotoamanecer.png" alt="Myself" caption="Myself" >}} 

🔧 I enjoy finding solutions to problems, even if it means working on them for days. **The satisfaction and joy of solving them is worth it!**  
I'm open to any **proposals!** You can download my CV [here](https://github.com/AlvaroEsRo/Resume/raw/main/RESUME_ALVARO_ESTEVEZ.pdf).

# My Future Plans

Right now, I’m looking for a **master's program** to study abroad outside of my country, Spain. I want to have an international experience, meet new people, and learn from others. I’d also like to understand how people work in different countries and ask myself whether I want to stay in that country or come back to Spain.
