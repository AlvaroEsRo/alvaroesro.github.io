## Introduction

In a world where having an online presence is key, most people rely on platforms like **LinkedIn** to display their professional journey. While it's a great tool, I felt it wasn't enough for me. I needed more than just a place to list my achievements—I wanted a space where I could share my projects, findings, and the challenges I've faced off. That’s when I decided to build my own **Personal Website**. 


## 🔧 What You’ll Find on My Website:
- **Project Portfolio**: Here, I’ll be documenting all my projects, from university assignments to personal experiments. Each project comes with a detailed breakdown of the challenges I faced, the solutions I implemented, and what I learned in the process.
- **Blog**: I plan to share my thoughts, experiences, and technical findings on a variety of topics. 
- **Skills and Tools**: The website also highlights the various tools and languages I’ve mastered, along with practical examples of how I’ve applied them.

## 🔍 How I Built It

Creating a website isn’t just about adding another link to your resume. It’s about having control over how you present yourself. By building this site, I’m not limited to a set structure or format; I can shape it based on my evolving skills and interests.

I created the website using **Hugo**, a powerful static site generator. It took a lot of effort to learn how to use this tool effectively, but with time and persistence, I was able to master it. I started by using a theme as a foundation—this gave me a solid starting point. From there, I customized it to fit my personal style and needs.

One of the most exciting parts of building this website was how much I learned in the process. From **HTML** and **CSS** to **GitHub Actions** for automating deployments, every step was an opportunity to improve. I even configured the site to update automatically whenever I push changes to my GitHub repository. This not only taught me about **continuous integration**, but also about making sure my work is always accessible and up to date.

## 🛠️ Challenges Faced

Building a website sounds straightforward, but like any project, it came with its own set of challenges. The biggest problem was ensuring the site looked good on both **desktop** and **mobile devices**. Responsive design is crucial, especially when I know potential employers or collaborators might check out my portfolio on their phones. Another challenge was making the site **scalable**. As I continue to learn and take on new projects, I wanted to make sure that my website can easily grow alongside me without becoming cluttered or difficult to navigate.

## 💡 What’s Next?

Creating this website was just the beginning. My next step is to regularly update it with new projects and blog posts. I see it as a way to hold myself accountable—not only to finish projects but also to reflect on what I’ve learned from them. I’m excited to see how this platform evolves and how it can showcase my growth as a developer.

In the end, this website isn’t just for others to see what I’ve done. It’s also for me—to track my progress, see how I’ve improved, and remind myself that with enough time and effort, I can solve even the toughest problems.
